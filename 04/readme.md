# ðŸ§  Notes

- `int` is **not iterable**.
- To iterate using `len()`, use it inside a `range()` function.
- **`lstrip()`**:
  - Removes characters from the **left side** of a string until the specified character is reached.
  - By default, removes leading blank spaces.
- **`rstrip()`**:
  - Removes characters from the **right side** of a string starting from the specified character.
  - By default, removes trailing blank spaces.
- Using `_` as the loop variable in a `for` loop indicates the variable is **intentionally unused**.
