Today I slacked quite a bit so my progress today is very minute, but its something none the less

# Topics learned today
- print()
-input()

# Things I might forget
- print():
    - sep(): Specifies how to separate the objects if there is more than one in a given print() function. Default is a space (' ').
    - end='end': Specifies what to print at the end of print() function. Default is a newline character ('\n').
- input():
    - The input() function always returns a string. Use int() to convert inputs to integers when needed.

# Tomorrow I will try to cover operators and control flow statements as a punishment to slacking
