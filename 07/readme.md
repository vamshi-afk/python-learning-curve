# Topics covered today
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

# Things I might forget:

- A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are individual instances of that class.
- A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. In Python, the __init__ method serves as the constructor. It sets up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its data members.
- self is a special reference used within class methods to refer to the current instance of the class.
- If both class and object have an attribute with the same name, the object attribute takes priority for that instance.
- Protected Members: Prefixing a variable name with a single underscore. This indicates that the member is intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses, but Python does not enforce this restriction.
- Private Members: Double underscores before a member name to make it private. This restricts access to the member from outside the class by performing name mangling.
- Encapsulation: Restricting access to the data members, ensuring that only necessary parts are exposed publicly.
- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and only exposing the necessary functionality.
- Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
- Concrete subclasses must implement all abstract methods.
- Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods.
- If a class does not implement all abstract methods, it becomes abstract.
