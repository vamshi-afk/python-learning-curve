## Operator
- Short-circuting in python:
    - Python stops evaluating the expression when the overall result of the expression is reached like not evaluating the second expression in logical 'and' operation when the first is false.
    - Short-circuting improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary evaluations
    - It also plays a role in preventing errors, especially when the second expression depends on the first.

- empty string is treated as false.
- Identity Operators are used to compare the memory location of two objects.
- In list even if they have same content, they occupy different memory locations.
- left shift '<<' multiplication by 2^x where x is the number of shifts, it shifts bits to the left.
- Right shift '>>' division by 2^x where x is the number of shifts, it shifts bits to the right.
- 1's complement is inversion of all bits and 2's complement is adding 1 to Least significant bit (LSB)
