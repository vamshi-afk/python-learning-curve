    - String
    - List
    - Tuple

# Things I might forget:

- String:
    - ord(): returns the integer representing the Unicode of the given character.
    - chr(): returns the character corresponding to a given integer.
    - escape sequence are used to include special characters which would otherwise be impossible to represent using '\' backslash before the special character.
    - raw strings are special type of string which do not process the escape sequences, useful when dealing with strings which include multiple backslashes like file paths.
    - raw strings are defined by r or R followed by the string in quotes.
    - Formatted strings in Python help us insert variables into strings neatly and efficiently via f''.
    - The in operator is used to check if a substring exists within another string. It returns True if the substring is found, otherwise False.
    - Strings are immutable in Python, so concatenation creates a new string object.
    - capitalize() only capitalizes only the first letter of the word whereas title() capitalizes first letter of each word in a string.


- List:
    - To add multiple elements, use loops. Tuples, which are immutable, can also be added using append(). Unlike Sets, Lists can have other lists appended to them.
    - del(): del is a keyword used to delete variables or items from a list by index.
    - remove(): removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.
    - pop(): removes and returns an item at a specified index. If no index is specified, it removes and returns the last item.
