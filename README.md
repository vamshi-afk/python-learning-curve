# python-learning-curve

This repository contains practice scripts and concise learning notes from my Python journey.

I followed the free [GeeksforGeeks Python course](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/python-course-certification-free) as my primary reference, but all notes and examples are rewritten in my own words.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These notes are **not teaching material**. They're made to **help me retain and revisit tricky concepts**, not to explain beginner-level terms. If you're looking for definitions like "What is a string?" ‚Äî this isn't the right place.

## üß† About This Repo

- Each topic is in its own folder (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.), with:
  - A `README.md` summarizing important points.
  - A `Problems/` subfolder containing related practice scripts.
- The goal is to keep both theory and code well organized.
- Notes are intentionally concise, focusing on areas I found tricky or worth revisiting.

## üìå How to Use This Repo

- Browse by folder/topic.
- Use the topic-level READMEs as quick-reference notes.
- Run the practice scripts locally to solidify your understanding.
