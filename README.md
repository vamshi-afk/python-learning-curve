# python-learning-curve

This repository contains practice scripts and concise learning notes from my Python journey.

I'm currently following the free Python course from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/python-course-certification-free) as my primary resource.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These notes are **not teaching material**. They're written to **help me retain and revisit tricky concepts**, not explain every beginner term. If you're looking for definitions like "What is a string?" ‚Äî you won't find them here.

## üß† About This Repo

- The repo is organized by topic folders named with numbers (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.) representing different learning stages.
- Each topic folder contains:
  - A `readme.md` file summarizing key concepts and notes for that topic.
  - A `Problems` subfolder with related practice scripts and, sometimes, further subfolders grouping problem types.
- This structure helps keep theory and practice code organized and easy to browse.
- All scripts and notes are written and tested by me during my learning journey.
- Notes are concise and focused on tricky concepts rather than detailed beginner definitions.


## üìå How to Use This Repo

- Browse by folder/topic.  
- Use the per-stage `README.md` files as a cheat sheet.  
- Clone and run the scripts to try them yourself.
